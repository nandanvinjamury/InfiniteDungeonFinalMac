Once you download the zip file, apple should automatically extract it for you. 

Inside the files, you should see three key folders: InfiniteDungeonMac, Scripts, and TestGenerationMac. 

The first is the game, with full playability using a keyboard and mouse. 

Mac is tight on security and will not allow you to just open the application. You must right click the app (don’t right click randomly in the folder or the options menu will look different), click open, then ok. 

There is a dialogue cutscene initially which can be entirely skipped by pressing s.

wasd to move in game, mouse click to shoot.

Besides that, there are quit buttons on the menu and game over screen, but no way to quit mid game. 

I would recommend pressing Cmd+Q to quit or to die, then press the quit button. 

There is no actual end to the game until you die, since clearing all enemies restarts the level with a different procedural dungeon layout. 

The final folder, test generation, is useful for being able to see the entire dungeon layout maps without gameplay. 

Again, you must right click the app (don’t right click randomly in the folder or the options menu will look different), click open, then ok. 

Once you click play to start, the retry layout button attempts to reorganize the same rooms in a different order/layout if possible. 

If you look at a room with a peculiar size, you can usually follow where it is when clicking the retry layout button. Otherwise, the new layout button discards the current layout and generates a new one.
